FEATURES
    Channels
        Journal Entries
            Structured Conversation
            Tagging
            Crosslinking
        Bookmarks Channels
            Bookmarks like Journal Entries
                Structured Conversation
                Tagging
                Crosslinking
        Users are Private Channels (DM)
    Threads
        IBIS, connections, etc all in one
            SLACK gives threads over to a tiny column
    RECENT CHANGES
        A History Channel (like bookmarks, not editable)
            MOVE from front page?
        Recent changes on the user's object (dynamic)
            SLACK changes the color of things you haven't seen
                but it's a pain wandering through them
PRIVACY POLICIES
    ALL NODES in a PRIVATE Channel are PRIVATE
    ALL NODES in a PUBLIC Channel are PUBLIC
        THIS MEANS, must check parent node for privacy
SCENARIOS
MASTER TODO
    Check parent nodes for privacy in all response nodes
    ADD INDEX to Channels file and keep channels sorted
        in alphabetcal order. Fetch from that index
    BORROW CSS from TQPortal
    NO Channel_View as AJAX Call to Channels 
        Otherwise, it must repaint the channel view
    DID ON BOOT Check to see if we have Bookmarks and General channels
        Bookmarks are entries in the Bookmark channel
        ADD THAT CALL TO environment.js at the bottom
            ChannelModel.bootstrap();
    PAINTING a Channel 
        SLACK etc is last on the bottom
            That way replies can be below
        US: last on top
            All you see is the hyperlink to the entry itself
            Entry replaces the index space
BUGS
    20180105
        *label_details_form.hbs not validating privacy
        *webmenubar Tree painting wrong
    20180104
        FIXT MenuBar doing a terrible job of showing the curcon stuff
        FIXT CurrentCono for the menu bar assumes conversation: needs curcontype
        FIXT TreeView not painting
        Poor Radio UX
        Journals from Channels are supposed to follow their Channel's 
            privacy. Still, privacy radios are showing
            HAH!!! THEY DO. BUT, NOT other child nodes.
            BIG POLICY ISSUE
        FIXT convo.js post newnode does a poor job of returning
            It assumed a conversation node. Now return the convo node
